        <p>
          In today's fast-paced software development landscape, ensuring the
          quality and reliability of upstream contributions is crucial. The
          traditional approach of testing at the end of the development cycle is
          no longer sufficient. To address this challenge, we present "Shift
          Left Your Testing with Packit and Testing Farm", a talk that
          introduces two powerful tools designed to simplify and enhance the
          testing process for the upstream contributions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Packit and Testing Farm provide a dead simple way to build and test
          your upstream contributions against both public or internal Red Hat
          testing infrastructure. In this talk, we will explore the capabilities
          of both tools and demonstrate how they can be seamlessly integrated
          into your development workflow.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to the current capabilities, we will share our plans for
          Packit and Testing.

        Do you want to automate how you build and test your RPM packages? Do you
        maintain any package in Fedora and want to automate the releases? Or are
        you just interested in CI/CD on GitHub or GitLab, Fedora and integration
        of upstream projects with RPM-based Linux distributions? In this
        session, we are going to deep-dive into features of Packit that can help
        you do your day-to-day job.
