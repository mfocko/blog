I'd like to share my experience and views on some of the talks that I've
attended on the DevConf.cz 2024.

<!--truncate-->

## Day 1

Let's start with the first day which was Thursday this year as opposed to the
previous years when the conference started on Friday and finished on Sunday.

Let's start with the _[keynote]_. The keynote wasn't very interesting, at some of
the slides actually felt like advertisement for other talks on the topic of the
AI‚Ä¶

Next talk about _[event-driven Ansible]_ was way more interesting. It allows you
to run Ansible playbooks after provisioning hosts, or on certain events, such as
discovered vulnerabilities. On one hand it feels like a very nice thing, but on
the other one I can't help but to think how you need to write the playbooks, so
that they are generic enough. One more example that's been given comes from the
possibility to react to tickets, e.g., outages and this feels like something
that could be abused to cause DoS.

Afterwards we've seen two lightning talks, one about
_[choosing the right OpenShift size]_ which was a pretty quick, but listed all
of the possible ways you can deploy OpenShift in detail. This lightning talk
was followed by the first AI (lightning) talk I've attended about
_[rapid prototyping]_ of the open-source AI models.

As someone who's involved in the automation of the RPM packaging and testing, of
course, we had to attend _[Learning from Nix]_. Nix has a very intriguing
concept which is pretty powerful, but painful at the same time. This can be
summed up pretty nicely by [Tsoding] who got asked about some tips & tricks for
someone who wants to try out NixOS:

> Just don't.

And now we're moving into a section where everything revolves about the Packit
Team :)

First talk about _[changelogs]_ was an interactive session that was (probably)
meant to share different approaches we take to handle this rather convoluted
topic that involves changelogs on both upstream and also on downstream with no
rules[^1].

Next one was about _[static analysis]_ done by [OpenScanHub]. I like the idea of
running the static analysis that can uncover nasty bugs (as it has been even
showed in the talk) at the same time as they are introduced. I gotta admit that
after seeing the UI of the [deployed OpenScanHub] on the Fedora Infra, I couldn't
help but to think about the [United States Graphics Company] :smile: The UI is
to the point, no fancy annoying shit, you get what you need, it's hard to get
lost. **Just simplicity.** Best kind of UI/UX in my opinion.

After the OpenScanHub talk we're getting to talks that were taken in a totally
different direction from the usual talks you're used to :wink: First one was
given title of _[‚ÄúIndiana Jones and obsoleted projects‚Äù]_ by [Mirek]. He talked
about projects that got obsoleted, but started with projects that had no
relation to IT field at all. I'd mark this talk as a _stand up_ without any
hesitation.

And finally we will wrap up the first day with the talk where speakers spoke the
least‚Ä¶ _[‚ÄúLet the users speak!‚Äù]_ that involved users of both Packit and
Testing Farm who spoke about their use case and benefits they gained from using
both services in a symbiosis.

## Day 2

On the second day I've attended less talks to not burn myself out :) I've
started with an AI-related talk with title _[‚ÄúAI: Open source will save us!‚Äù]_,
even though this talk has been improvised, as the speakers from the schedule
couldn't have attended, it provided a nice overview what [InstructLab] can do
and how can you ‚Äúfeed‚Äù the relevant info into the language models by yourself.

After that I attended a _‚Äúcoffee enthusiasts Meetup‚Äù_ which was very nice and,
of course, an organized chaos :wink:

Before attending the social event I wrapped up the second day with a lightning
talk about _[recent updates in Toolbx]_. I've used both [toolbx] and
[distrobox], so it's nice to see the improvements in progress and also that both
projects are well and lively.

## Day 3

On the third day I've attended only in the afternoon. ‚ÄúStarted‚Äù my day with
a discussion _[‚ÄúLeadership: Where people skills meet programmers‚Äù]_ which was
very nice for gaining an insight into how developer, manager and QE lead roles
overlap.

That talk has been followed up by a talk about [role rotation] in our Packit
Team. I would say it is a nice ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù to the agile process which allows you
to not create a single point of failure in the mundane and repetitive processes
within your team.

And this day has been finished off with a talk about [shifting left] in Podman.
It's nice to see how other teams utilize our Packit Service and also the
services we rely on, such as [Copr] or [Testing Farm]. With the help of Cockpit
tests they can catch breaking changes early on, or even bugs that have been
introduced and break usage of the dependent projects.

## Picks from the Packit Team

On the Tuesday, during our Packit stand up, I have managed to abuse my
Kanban Lead role to collect some of the talks that each of us would recommend:

- [Rapid Prototyping] with Open Source AI Models
- Do you like your [changelogs]?
- OpenScanHub - [Static Analysis] of a Linux Distribution
- Creating a [Language Server] for RPM Spec Files
- Containers and Kubernetes Made Easy: A 15-minute dive into [Podman Desktop]
- [‚ÄúLeadership: Where people skills meet programmers‚Äù]

## Wrap up

I have to admit that these 3 days have been pretty exhaustive, including
information overload :smile: but at the same time it was really nice to meet
with the colleagues and at least some of our users who are not based in Brno.
