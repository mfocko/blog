In this part you can find „random“ additional materials I have written over the
course of teaching _Algorithms and data structures I_.

It is a various mix of stuff that may have been produced as a follow-up on some
question asked at the seminar or spontanously.

If you have some ideas for posts, please do not hesitate to submit them as issues
in the linked [GitLab](https://gitlab.fi.muni.cz/xfocko/kb/issues).
